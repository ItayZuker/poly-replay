# Overview

Poly Real is schedule-driven Polymarket **up/down** trading: build phase-based setups, place them on a UTC week grid, preview in demo, then go live.

## What you can do

- Watch live windows (quotes, chart, PTB vs price)
- Build **setups** with timed buy/sell phases
- Place setups on a **Schedule** (day × UTC hour)
- Use **Replay** mode on Schedule to trial setups over recent history (separate board from Live)
- Run **demo**, then **live** with your wallet
- Use the **Heatmap** for historical window activity
- Toggle **Recording** per market for Replay/Heatmap data; deploy the same app as a recorder and/or live trader (`TRADING_EXECUTOR`) so Replay shares the trading engine
